# Portfolio
A homepage to display all the other cool things I work on!

I was certain I wanted to make something that read as a dark theme, and well it's still pretty ugly it's at least that. This project also features some very basic resizing adaptability with flexbox elements as well as cool mouseover and highlight effects for images and text.
